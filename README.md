# OpenCV

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a very important library for developing real-time computer vision applications. It is mainly used for image processing, video capture and analytics.		 We can
•	Read and write images
•	Capture and save videos
•	Process images (filter, transform etc.)
In the Baisc Operations folder, I am including the basic operations such as reading images/ videos, converting to different color models, blurring the image, edge cascading and morphological operations such as dilation and erosion.
